The Toroidal Hive Artificial Neural Network (THANN) is an innovative AI framework designed to integrate cutting-edge quantum-inspired models with robust neural architectures. It leverages models like Quantum Neural Adaptive Learning Systems, YOLOv8 for visual processing, and Meta-Llama for advanced reasoning, combining them into a powerful sequential pipeline. This system is inspired by toroidal geometry, enabling modularity, adaptability, and high computational efficiency.
