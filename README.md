# Toroidal Hive Artificial Neural Network (THANN)

**Toroidal Hive Artificial Neural Network (THANN)** is a revolutionary AI architecture that combines multiple advanced modalities, including text processing, visual data analysis, and self-regulation, within a unique toroidal design. THANN is designed to address complex challenges in artificial intelligence by integrating cutting-edge models for input, hidden layers, and outputs into a cohesive and scalable framework.

The foundation of THANN lies in its ability to process diverse data inputs, adapt dynamically through self-healing and regulation mechanisms, and generate context-aware outputs. By leveraging energy-efficient operations and ethical considerations, THANN stands out as a model for sustainable and responsible AI.

## Key Features

1. **Multimodal Input Processing:**
   - Utilises Falcon Mamba for efficient text embeddings.
   - Includes energy-optimised input mechanisms to process diverse data types seamlessly.

2. **Advanced Hidden Layer Design:**
   - Integrates YOLOv8 for visual feature extraction and object detection.
   - Implements self-regulation with Self-RAG, enabling dynamic reflection and adaptation.
   - Incorporates modular, toroidal architecture for recursive feedback and fault tolerance.

3. **Contextual and Sentient Output:**
   - Combines reasoning capabilities with Meta-Llama for actionable, ethical decisions.
   - Reflects on outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy using principle-driven alignment.

4. **Sustainable and Ethical AI:**
   - Focuses on energy efficiency with Dolphin and other resource-conscious methodologies.
   - Aligns with ethical principles to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability.
