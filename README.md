# **Toroidal Hive (THANN) — README**

## **Overview**
The **Toroidal Hive (THANN)** project aims to develop a highly advanced, self-healing, and adaptive neural network architecture. This system combines cutting-edge features such as:
- **Quantum Adaptive Learning (QAL)** for quantum-accelerated processing.  
- **Social Hive Learning (SHL)** for distributed, collaborative intelligence.  
- **Emotion-Driven Learning (EDL)** for priority adjustment based on simulated emotional cues.  
- **Toroidal (looped) Architecture** for continuous feedback and fault tolerance.

This code integrates various libraries—Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, Nanotron, and Sentence Transformers—to demonstrate how a multimodal and “toroidal” approach might look in practice.

## **Key Features**

1. **Multimodal Pipelines**  
   - Text generation (`text-generation` pipeline).  
   - Fill-mask predictions (`fill-mask` pipeline).  
   - Image classification (`image-classification` pipeline).  
   - Zero-shot image classification (`zero-shot-image-classification` pipeline).  
   - Text-to-text transformations (e.g., emotion classification).

2. **Toroidal Hive Model**  
   - An example PyTorch module illustrating how outputs can loop back into earlier layers, enabling redundancy and self-correction.

3. **Example Quantum and Distributed Extensions**  
   - Placeholder sections for quantum computing libraries (IBM Qiskit or TensorFlow Quantum) and swarm intelligence techniques (blockchain or distributed ledger support).

4. **Nanotron Training**  
   - Demonstrates advanced distributed training through the Nanotron library, which enables scaling across multiple GPUs or nodes.

### **Key Files**
- **`toroidal_hive.py`**: Main Python script combining the different Hugging Face pipelines, a conceptual Toroidal Hive model, and optional Nanotron training logic.  
- **`config_tiny_llama.yaml`**: Example Nanotron configuration file for large-scale distributed training.  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Recommended dependencies (PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence Transformers, Nanotron, vLLM, etc.).

## **Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/toroidal_hive.git
   cd toroidal_hive
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If you see any missing dependencies, install them via pip or conda.*

4. **(Optional) Install Additional Libraries**  
   - **vLLM**: `pip install vllm`  
   - **Quantum Libraries** (if using QAL aspects): `pip install qiskit` or `pip install tensorflow-quantum`  
   - **Nanotron** (for distributed training): `pip install nanotron`

## **Usage**

1. **Basic Demo**  
   Run the main script to load the pipelines, generate sentence embeddings, and (optionally) train the Toroidal Hive model:
   ```bash
   python toroidal_hive.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Try to load each pipeline (skipping those with missing dependencies).  
   - Print similarity matrices for sample sentences.  
   - Print simple demonstration outputs (e.g., text generation, fill-mask predictions).

2. **Run Training with Nanotron**  
   ```bash
   python toroidal_hive.py --train --config-file examples/config_tiny_llama.yaml
   ```
   - `--train`: Activates the training loop.  
   - `--config-file`: Points to your Nanotron configuration file for advanced distributed training.

3. **Serving a Large Language Model with vLLM** (Optional)  
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     vllm serve "bartowski/Buzz-8b-Large-v0.5-GGUF"
     ```
   - Query the model via HTTP `POST`:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/completions" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{
              "model": "bartowski/Buzz-8b-Large-v0.5-GGUF",
              "prompt": "Once upon a time,",
              "max_tokens": 512,
              "temperature": 0.5
          }'
     ```

## **Customisation**
1. **Model Names**  
   - Replace placeholders like `"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"` or `"bartowski/Buzz-8b-Large-v0.5-GGUF"` with actual model names accessible to your environment.

2. **ToroidalHiveModel**  
   - Extend or modify the `ToroidalHiveModel` class in `toroidal_hive.py` to include:  
     - **Quantum layers** if using quantum computing libraries.  
     - **Emotion-driven modules** that adjust learning rates or behaviour.  
     - **Self-healing logic** that monitors layer outputs for anomalies.

3. **Data Pipeline**  
   - Adapt the script to handle your specific multimodal datasets (images, text, etc.).  
   - Update the Nanotron config to reflect your dataset paths, preprocessing scripts, and training parameters.

4. **Social Hive Learning**  
   - For decentralised or swarm intelligence, investigate strategies such as:  
     - **Blockchain** for synchronising agent states.  
     - **Peer-to-peer** networks for sharing learned parameters among different nodes.

## **Troubleshooting**
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check the `requirements.txt` or manually install the required libraries.  
- **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure the model references are valid on Hugging Face Hub or locally available.  
- **GPU/TPU Resources**: Large models may require extensive GPU/TPU memory. Ensure you have the right hardware or use smaller models for development.  
- **Nanotron Timeouts**: Adjust your parallel context or caching strategy if you encounter timeouts on multi-GPU setups.

## **Contributing**
1. **Fork the Repository** and create a new feature branch.  
2. **Make Your Changes**: Add your modifications to the `ToroidalHiveModel` or the training pipelines.  
3. **Test** thoroughly, ensuring backward compatibility.  
4. **Create a Pull Request**: Provide a clear summary of your changes, motivations, and test results.
