Toroidal Hive Artificial Neural Network (THANN)
Overview
The Toroidal Hive Artificial Neural Network (THANN) is an innovative AI architecture combining advanced multimodal data processing, self-regulation, and ethical reasoning. Inspired by the infinite loops of toroidal geometry, THANN is built to adapt, evolve, and align with human values while leveraging distributed computing for scalability and efficiency.

THANN integrates NVIDIA Megatron-LM, a state-of-the-art framework for distributed training of large-scale models, enabling seamless scalability and precision. This system processes diverse inputs such as text, images, and reflective reasoning, creating a cohesive AI model for advanced real-world applications.
